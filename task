#The Task
#So continuing from where we left off in Step1. We now have a launch file which opens gazebo, empty world and spawns the robot.

#If you do that and then do rostopic list, you should find two topic of interest:

    /cmd_vel
    /odom

#which are defined in the urdf file, gazebo plugin.

#Now we shall create a rospy node: controller.py that will

    subscribe to /odom and
    publish to /cmd_vel

    1.So in your package directory, create a your_package_name/scripts/ directory and create a file name controller.py inside it.

    2.Now let’s start writing the controller.py file.

#We’ll need some variables to keep track of pose of the robot, x, y, theta.
self.hb_x = 0
self.hb_y = 0
self.hb_theta = 0

#We’ll need a callback function for subscribing to /odom. As you must be aware by now, this function will be automatically called everytime to update the pose of the robot (whenever there is an update in the /odom topic).
def odometryCb(msg):
    global hb_x, hb_y, hb_theta
    # Write your code to take the msg and update the three variables:-

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
import time

from tf_transformations import euler_from_quaternion

        super().__init__('hb_task1b_controller')
        
        # Initialze Publisher and Subscriber
        # We'll leave this for you to figure out the syntax for
        # initialising publisher and subscriber of cmd_vel and odom respectively

        # Declare a Twist message
        self.vel = Twist()
        # Initialise the required variables to 0

        # For maintaining control loop rate.
        self.rate = self.create_rate(100)
        # Initialise variables that may be needed for the control loop
        # For ex: x_d, y_d, theta_d (in **meters** and **radians**) for defining desired goal-pose.
        # and also Kp values for the P Controller


        # client for the "next_goal" service
        self.cli = self.create_client(NextGoal, 'next_goal')

                # This is probably the crux of Task 1, figure this out and rest should be fine.
